Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
#id
*
element
element, element
element1 element2            (all element2's inside element1)
element1 > element2          (element2 that has an element1 parent)
element1 + element2          (element2 that comes directly after element1)
:hover                       (When you hover over element, it changes accordingly)
:last-child                  (last element under their parent with specifed selector)
:first-child                 (first element under their parent with specifed selector)              
!important (not recommended) (placed after the property and makes it override all cascade styling rules)


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
