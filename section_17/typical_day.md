# Typical Day of a developer

- git checkout master of the project you have branched off of.
- git pull that file. Maybe it is a git pull upstream master if it is a forked project.
- Check the project management software you work with and update it based on your days tasks/what you are working on.
- Stand up meeting
  - What did you do yesterday?
  - What we are working on today?
  - what items that have highest urgency?
- Make a change on a development branch that is named according to what file/feature you are working on.
- git add, commit, push then request a pull request.
- PR to QA and merge to master
