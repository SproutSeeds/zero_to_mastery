      - Semantic versioning
        - the 4 means (left): major release
        - the 17 means (middle): minor release
        - the 3 (right most number): the patch release for bugs
  - npm install
    - if your project has a package.json has all the dependencies listed, this will install all of the listed dependencies in your package.json
  - npm run build
    - this will run a script called build that is under the scripts tag in the package.json
    - great to couple with browserify that bundles a script using all packages that can and will be ran with the browser
      - example
        - browserify my_script.js > bundle.js && live-server
          - bundles my script and makes a file named bundle.js and opens the index.html with the live-server
    - github security issues
      - there will be security alerts within your github repository that end up being fixable with updating outdate packages. You can also make your security fixes automated within your security alerts github tab.
    - npm install <package name>
      - this will install the latest version of the package
    - ^1
      - includes all packages with major release 1
